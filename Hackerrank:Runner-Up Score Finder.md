🏆 Hackerrank:Runner-Up Score Finder in Python
🎯 AIM:
To write a Python program that takes a list of scores from participants and finds the runner-up score (i.e., the second-highest score), eliminating any duplicates.

🧠 ALGORITHM:
1. Start
2. Create a variable n and get its value from the user (number of participants)
3. Read the list of n scores from the user using input().split() and convert them to integers
4. Store the scores in a list
5. Use set() to remove any duplicate scores
6. Convert the set back to a list and sort it in ascending order
7. Print the second-last element of the sorted list (i.e., the runner-up score)
8. Stop
💻 PROGRAM:
n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

arr.sort()

large=arr[-1]

arr.reverse()

for i in range(len(arr)-1):

if arr[i+1]<arr[i]:

print(arr[i+1])
    break

OUTPUT

RESULT
Thus the program is excuted and verified.
