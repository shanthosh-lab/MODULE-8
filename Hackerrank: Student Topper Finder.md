3.  Compute the percentage: percentage = (total / 300) * 100
4. Display total and percentage.
5. Stop

💻 PROGRAM:
m1,m2,m3=int(input()),int(input()),int(input())

total=m1+m2+m3;

percentage=(total/300)*100

print("Total marks obtained is {} and the percentage obtained is {}".format(total,percentage))

OUTPUT
