# # 🔢  Hackerrank:# 🏆 Student Average marks and percentage


This Python program helps determine the **top-performing student** based on the total marks across five subjects. It uses a dictionary to store each student’s marks and identifies the topper using simple calculations and built-in functions.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To Write a python program to read the marks of three subjects from the users and calculate the total and percentage for that particular student.


## 🧠 Algorithm

1.Start
2.Input marks of three subjects: m1, m2, m3.
3.Compute the total marks: total = m1 + m2 + m3
4.Compute the percentage: percentage = (total / 300) * 100
5.Display total and percentage.
6.Stop


---

## 💻 PROGRAM:
m1,m2,m3=int(input()),int(input()),int(input())

total=m1+m2+m3;

percentage=(total/300)*100

print("Total marks obtained is {} and the percentage obtained is {}".format(total,percentage))
